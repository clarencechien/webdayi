      "title": "THE REAL FIX: Frequency bonus added to DP scores (v2.3)",
      "summary": "Previous tie-breaking approaches (v2.1, v2.2) were insufficient. The real solution is to bake frequency preference into DP scores as a tiny bonus. This ensures backtracking naturally follows paths through high-frequency characters.",
      "changes": [
        "CRITICAL: Added frequency bonus (freq * 1e-9) directly to DP scores",
        "Previous approaches only affected transition choices, not overall path selection",
        "Now when N-gram scores are equal, high-frequency paths get slightly higher DP scores",
        "Applied to both initializeDP() and forwardPass()",
        "Updated both production (viterbi_module.js) and debug (viterbi_module_debug.js) versions",
        "Upgraded algorithm to v2.3"

      "title": "CRITICAL FIX: Added tie-breaking to backtrack() function",
      "changes": [
        "Fixed viterbi_module.js backtrack() to use frequency-based tie-breaking",
        "Fixed viterbi_module_debug.js backtrack() with same tie-breaking logic",
        "Upgraded algorithm to v2.2 (complete tie-breaking coverage)",
        "When multiple candidates at final position have equal scores, prefer higher-frequency character",

      "root_cause": [
        "v2.1 only fixed tie-breaking in forwardPass() (choosing best previous character)",
        "But backtrack() had NO tie-breaking when selecting final character",
        "When '嬌' and '如' both had equal final scores, JavaScript object iteration order determined winner",
